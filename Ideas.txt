Nick's Random Ideas

Ideas for things that could be included in the game:

1. Every district has it's own background art, which is the same for most locations in the district. 
--Certain locations can have different background art, based on what they are. 
--Players can pay to have a different background art commissioned for their locations. (Mike's idea is to buy a header slot)
