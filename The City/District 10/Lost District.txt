The Lost District

The Fall
Only a few years ago, the Nature & Wildlife District's Spokes were damaged in a dispute between unknown parties. Many of the inhabitants of the Lost District went missing or were killed in the chaos and destruction in the initial breach and the days that followed, including the Governor. Most believe the media's stories, however it is known by SOME of the CBC and the Governors that the 8th Governor of District 9 was assassinated by some unknown force rising wihin the shadows of the Hub. They are fervently seeking any information they can garner on said force while attempting to keep it as covered up as possible. (This was the first true act of terrorism from the conflict breeding between the Governors, the Tourniquet and the Rupture.)

As a result of losing the containment that the Spokes provided, the entire district was quickly flooded with a large amount of Genre Bleed from the gates to the ports. Most of the district's survivors fled through the world ports, never to return. Those who were forced to flee through the Gates were cut off from their own lands and were forced to scatter, seeking asylum within the other districts. Some of their lands were lost completely to the Hub but others seem to have been opening up in various other Districts. 

After
The area adapted rather quickly, a new Governor of unknown origins rising from the ashes to form District 10, the Apocalyptic/Post-Apocalyptic District. There are various small and hardly controlled factions and guilds forming this dystopian district.
