Nick's Random Ideas

Ideas for things that could be included in the game:

1) Every district has it's own background art, which is the same for most locations in the district. Certain locations can have different background art, based on what they are. Players can pay to have a different background art commissioned for their locations. (Mikes idea is to buy a header slot)
